# ToDoList
Hey! Some time ago I created a ToDoList program in Visual Studio Winforms that can stores data. First, you need to log into an administrator account or create one. Then you can add notes to the list as many as you like. If you want, you can edit or delete the note. In my opinion, it's a very simple project, but I'm proud of it. To log in use test/test.
