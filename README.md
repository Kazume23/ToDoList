# ToDoList
Hey! It's me again. A while back I created a ToDoList program that stores data. First, you need to log into an administrator account or create one. Then you can add notes to the list as many as you like. If you want, you can edit or delete the note. In my opinion, it's a very simple project, but I am very proud of it.
